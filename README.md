# Question 1:  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STACK AND A QUEUE
> A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle. A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.


>The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

# Question 5: Even numbers upto a given number in Ruby

### Methods adopted are loop and recursion

#### The solution is in the even_numbers_loop_recursion.rb file
># The Benchmark analysis yielded better result for the recursion and was found to be faster than the loop methods used to get even numbers 1000 times for numbers 0 to 30

# Question 6: A helper method module in Ruby to titleize a given string
