# Question 1:  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STACK AND A QUEUE
> A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle. A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.
